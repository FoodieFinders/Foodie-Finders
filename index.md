## Overview

The problem: There are many food choices on campus: campus center, food trucks, Manoa Gardens, Paradise Palms, vending machines, and so forth. Let’s say you have a desire for chinese food today for lunch. What places on campus are serving chinese food menu items today? Alternatively, let’s say that you love the fresh salmon fillet at Campus Center, but that dish is only served once every few weeks. How do you find out on the day that it’s available?

The solution: The Manoa Munchie app enables you to login on your phone and determine:

What specific menu items will be available today at campus center locations;
What food is available right now.
When a style of food you love is available today.

## Development

The development process will be conforming to the Issue Driven Project Management style of development. The development is consisted of several milstones, each having several tasks meant for each person in the group. 

## Landing Page

Upon launching the application, users are welcomed to the landing interface featuring "Today's Top Picks"—a curated showcase of the day's most esteemed dining
selections based on peer reviews and ratings. Next to this feature there will be a selection portal, where the user can identify themselves as either a vendor or a student. Vendors are redirected to their Vendor Home Page, and students are able to leave reviews on meals they have tried.




## User Home Page




## User profile page




## Vendor home page





## Add Vendor page




## Today’s top picks page










## Admin home page








## Milestone 1

The first milestone consists of the development of HTML pages, meant to be a mockup of the Manoa Munchies app. This includes the development of the UI/UX, the general aesthetic considerations, and the beginnings of how users would be using it.

By the end of this milestone, the system would be deployed to Digital ocean. The following image contains the tasks divided out to group members.
