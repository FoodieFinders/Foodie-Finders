meteor-application-template-react is a sample Meteor 2.9 application that illustrates: 

* [Overview](#overview)
* [Team](#team)
* [Landing page](#landing-page)
* [User profile page](#user-profile-page)
* [Vendor home page](#vendor-home-page)
* [Milestone 1](#milestone-1)
* [About Us](#about-us)

The goal of this template is to help you get quickly started doing Meteor development by providing a reasonable directory structure for development and deployment, a set of common extensions to the core framework, and boilerplate code to implement basic page display, navigation, forms, roles, and collection manipulation.

To keep this codebase simple and small, some important capabilities are intentionally excluded from this template:

  * Unit Testing.
  * Security (meteor-application-template-react enables the insecure packages)
  * Deployment

The solution: The FoodieFinders app enables you to login on your phone and determine:

Examples of the these capabilities will be provided elsewhere.

Manoa Munchies is designed, and implemented by [Ricki Ace Gaborno](https://rickiace.github.io/),[Ezekiel Ira Nunez](https://ezekielira.github.io/), [Dan Vu](https://danvu42.github.io/), [Ibrahim Matar](https://hima700.github.io/) and [Joshuah D. Jones](https://jj17de.github.io/).

## Development

The development process will be conforming to the Issue Driven Project Management style of development. The development is consisted of several milstones, each having several tasks meant for each person in the group. 

## Landing Page

Upon launching the application, users are welcomed to the landing interface featuring "Today's Top Picks"—a curated showcase of the day's most esteemed dining
selections based on peer reviews and ratings. Next to this feature there will be a selection portal, where the user can identify themselves as either a vendor or a student. Vendors are redirected to their Vendor Home Page, and students are able to leave reviews on meals they have tried.



## User profile page

Upon arriving at the landing page, users can navigate to the sign-in link or, if already signed in, can select their username. This action redirects them to their profile page, which displays their personal information. On this page, users have the option to edit and update their profile details.For vendor users, the profile page serves as a platform to submit their restaurant details and credentials for verification and for students they have a selection to write a review.




## Vendor home page
<img src="docs/vendorpage.png">

Similar to the user profile page this page is exclusively for vendors. It provides a specialized space where vendors can add establishments they are currently operating. The page features an intuitive dashboard displaying reviews of their owned businesses as well as detailed information on each particular location. Additionally, vendors have the ability to make modifications to their business listings, ensuring their information is current and accurately reflects their offerings.


## Milestone 1

The first milestone consists of the development of HTML pages, meant to be a mockup of the Manoa Munchies app. This includes the development of the UI/UX, the general aesthetic considerations, and the beginnings of how users would be using it.

By the end of this milestone, the system would be deployed to Digital ocean. The following image contains the tasks divided out to group members.
